#Architecture: all
#Depends: eclipse-cdt (= ${source:Version}),

#Description: Autotools support for Eclipse CDT
# The Autotools suite of plugins adds to the CDT a support for building and
# maintaining C/C++ projects that use Autotools. With this additional support,
# a vast repository of C/C++ code can be checked out, built, and maintained
# under the CDT rather easily without having to resort to the command line.
# .
# In conjunction with the CDT, the plugin can do the following:
#  * Build a C/C++ project that uses a configure script or an autogen
#    script or a Makefile.cvs script
#  * Create a simple C or C++ hello world Autotools project via a template
#  * Allow configuration parameters to be set via a gui and to rebuild when
#    configuration parameters are changed
#  * Colorized editing of configuration files such as configure.in, configure.ac,
#    Makefile.am, and Makefile.in with full hover help for autoconf/automake
#    macros
#  * Allow specification of multiple build configurations for a single project
#  * Run autotools such as autoconf, automake, or aclocal directly using a gui
#    interface
#  * Includes hover help for autoconf and automake macros in the editors
